This work is based on [a response](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/40076/83041) from StackExchange user [Vidal S. Ramdal](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/users/21583/vidar-s-ramdal), which I have altered, streamlined and updated.

I have also modified the code to work around [a bug](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=1612) that is present in Google Apps Script. The bug damages [images that are copied across Docs files](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=1612#c14), and is still present as of March 2015.
